        <h4>Steps</h4>

            <ol>
                <li>Melt the butter in a pan or microwave and leave to cool for a bit.</li>
                <li>Combine the flour, baking soda, salt and lemon zest in a bowl and set aside.</li>
                <li>Once the butter has cooled, add it to a separate bowl with the sugars and combine.</li>
                <li>To this bowl add the eggs and mix well.</li>
                <li>Add the bowl of dry ingredients into the wet mixture and mix until a sticky dough is formed.</li>
                <li>For best results now let the dough chill in the fridge for a few hours.</li>
                <li>Roll the dough out into even balls. We recommend 80g each.</li>
                <li>In each ball form an opening with your thumb or the back of a teaspoon.</li>
                <li>Add a teaspoon of the blueberry jam into each of these. Make sure the cookie is jam side up 
                    when you add it to a baking tray.</li>
                <li>Add the dough balls to parchemtn lined baking trays, leaving enough space for them to spread out as they bake.</li>
                <li>Put the trays into a pre-heated oven at 180c and bake for 13 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove and allow to cool.</li>
            </ol>
