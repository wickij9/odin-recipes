        <h3>Brown butter cookie base with milk and dark chocolate chunks</h3>

        <p>This one is everything a cookie should be. Soft and chewy, sweet and salty, and rammed full of chocolate.
            Combining dark brown sugar with browned butter gives a richer, fuller flavour and also means you get that dark cookie colour.
        </p>

        <p>We use a mixture of chocolates and add a sprinkle of salt to really make the taste pop in your mouth and 
            to balance out some of the sweetness.
        </p>

        <p>This recipe will make around 45 cookies so feel free to divide as required for a smaller batch.</p>

                <li>Granulated sugar - 250g</li>
                <li>Large eggs - 6</li>
                <li>Dark chocolate chunks - 500g</li>
                <li>Milk Chocolate chunks - 300g</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the butter in a medium pan until it just boils. Leave to cool and darken.</li>
                <li>Combine the flour, baking soda and salt in a bowl and set aside.</li>
                <li>Once the butter has cooled, add it to a separate bowl with your sugars and mix well.</li>
                <li>To this bowl add the eggs and combine.</li>
                <li>Once combined, add in the bowl of dry ingredients from earlier and mix well.</li>
                <li>For best results now chill the dough in the fridge for a few hours.</li>
                <li>Roll the dough out into even balls. We recommend 80g each. </li>
                <li>Then push a few chocolate chunks into each dough ball.</li>
                <li>Add the dough balls to parchment lined baking trays, leaving enough space for them to spread out as they bake.</li>
                <li>Put the trays into a pre-heated oven at 180c and bake for 13 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove and allow to cool.</li>
            </ol>
